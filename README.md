# What is React Holy Grail?
The holy grail layout is a layout model commonly used in web design. It features a header area at the top of the page and a footer area at the bottom, spanning the full window width. Between the header and footer are three areas of equal height. The main body of content occupies the center area, with two panels of supporting content or interface elements on either side.

The name "holy grail" refers to a legendary sought-after thing. In the early 2000s, it was difficult to reliably achieve the holy grail layout using existing web technologies. Today the holy grail layout is trivial to implement using widely-adopted technologies, such as CSS Grid or Flexbox.
